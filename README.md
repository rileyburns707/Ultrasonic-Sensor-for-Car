# Ultrasonic-Sensor-for-Car
This is a project I worked during Summer 2023 for fun while I had some free time. 

Idea

My old car used to have a sensor on the back of it, and when I was backing up the sensor would beep faster and faster. So if I was 5 ft away it would be 20 bpm and when I was 2 inches away it would beat 1000 bpm. The numbers are just random but you get the idea. My idea was to have a sensor in the back with an on off switch that I can control from the driver seat so I can turn it on when I back up. JR was gracious enough to give me an ultrasonic sensor that he had bought and that could be a nice ground point. I still have the M5Stick+ from the FM transmitter project that could be of sum use.
