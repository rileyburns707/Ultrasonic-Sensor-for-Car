# Ultrasonic-Sensor-for-Car
This is a project I worked on during the Summer of 2023 for fun while I had some free time. 

Idea

My old car used to have a sensor on the back of it, and when I was backing up the sensor would beep faster and faster. So if I was 5 ft away it would be 20 bpm and when I was 2 inches away it would beat 1000 bpm. The numbers are just random but you get the idea. My idea was to have a sensor in the back with an on-off switch that I can control from the driver seat so I can turn it on when I back up. My lab professor was gracious enough to give me an ultrasonic sensor that he had bought and that could be a nice starting point. I still have the M5Stick+ from the FM transmitter project that could be of some use.

List of important things:
- Arduino Uno
- Breadboard and wires
- HC-SR04 - ultrasonic sensor
- Arduino Code. The code for this is in "Arduino Code" file
