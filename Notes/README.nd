So if the sensor works with the arduino I need to figure out how to get the sensor to beep at different frequencies depending on the distance. I will do increments of 5. So at 30 cm (~12 in) and above it will be a slower bpm. At 25 cm a little faster, at 20 cm a little faster, etc., and anything shorter than 10 cm it will be a constant beep. So large distance = low frequency and close distance = high frequency.  

I am thinking that I can use some kind of delay or some kind of counter to get the beeping to be different, but now that I am thinking that would not change the frequency but just when it beeps. Blink without delay might be useful.


Distance = (Speed x Time) / 2 
ex. (34cm/ms x 1.5ms) / 2 = 25.5cm

I could change this to make it a time thing. So between 0 - 600μs, 60Hz... and between 600- 1200μs, 100Hz. 
The tone() function could be useful
I could do if statements where if it is within 21-25 cm play this tone(). And just repeat that for different distances

if(duration<=900 && duration > 10)
{
tone(outPin, 150, 25);
}

Having 6 of this code for different range setups, and 1 with noTone(outPin) would seem to work.
